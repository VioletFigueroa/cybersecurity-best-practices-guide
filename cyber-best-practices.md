## Cyber Best Practices

### Project Overview

This project highlights cybersecurity best practices and recommendations for
organizations to enhance their security posture. The documentation includes
actionable strategies to effectively mitigate risks.

#### Objectives

1. **Identify Best Practices**: Research and document industry-standard
   cybersecurity practices.
2. **Provide Recommendations**: Offer practical advice for implementation.
3. **Support Evidence**: Include relevant artifacts and documentation.

### Project Deliverables

- 📄 [Cyber Best Practices (DOCX)](./Project%208%20-%20Cyber%20Best%20Practices.docx)
- 📄 [Cyber Best Practices (PDF)](./Project%208%20-%20Cyber%20Best%20Practices.pdf)
- 📄 [Cyber Best Practices (Markdown)](./Project%208%20-%20Cyber%20Best%20Practices.md)

### Supporting Artifacts & Evidence

- **Best Practices Documentation**: Detailed guidelines for securing networks,
  endpoints, and applications.
- **Case Studies**: Examples of successful implementations of these practices.
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Recommendations for tools and frameworks to support
  cybersecurity efforts, such as DataLocker for encrypted storage and DigiCert
  for secure email certificates.

### Implementation Strategy

To maximize security benefits while minimizing operational disruption, the
following phased approach is recommended:

#### Phase 1 (Immediate - 30 days)

- Implement a strong password policy.
- Deploy MFA for administrative and privileged accounts.
- Conduct initial education and awareness training.

#### Phase 2 (31-90 days)

- Implement a password expiration policy.
- Enable Full Disk Encryption on executive and high-risk laptops.
- Deploy VPN IPSec for remote workers.

#### Phase 3 (91-180 days)

- Roll out Secure Email certificates for sensitive departments.
- Encrypt all remaining company laptops and portable devices.
- Launch a comprehensive security training program.

### Key Learnings

- **Proactive Security Implementation**: Best practices reduce the likelihood
  of breaches.
- **Adaptability**: Tailoring practices to organizational needs ensures
  effectiveness.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Cybersecurity is an ongoing process requiring
  regular updates and reviews.
